## Introduction  <a name="introduction"></a>

(The "Introduction" text above is formatted in heading 2 style.) The main goal of this project is to explore the relationship between subscriber count of streaming services and stock returns of subsidiary companies. We will also be looking at how specific events impacted the stock returns and subscriber counts.   

## Methodology <a name="meth"></a>

Here is some code that we used to develop our analysis. This is the code we used to conduct our regression analysis between subscriber count and stock returns. [More details are provided in the Appendix](page2).
 
Note that for the purposes of the website, you have to copy this code into the markdown file and  
put the code inside trip backticks with the keyword `python`.

```python
import seaborn as sns 
iris = sns.load_dataset('iris') 

print(iris.head(),  '\n---')
print(iris.tail(),  '\n---')
print(iris.columns, '\n---')
print("The shape is: ",iris.shape, '\n---')
print("Info:",iris.info(), '\n---') # memory usage, name, dtype, and # of non-null obs (--> # of missing obs) per variable
print(iris.describe(), '\n---') # summary stats, and you can customize the list!
print(iris['species'].value_counts()[:10], '\n---')
print(iris['species'].nunique(), '\n---')
```

Notice that the output does NOT show! **You have to copy in figures and tables from the notebooks.**
